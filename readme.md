#RubyMotion

## Introduction

RubyMotion is used to write native apps for iOS, Android, and OS X, while using the Ruby language. It is mainly a tool designed for Ruby developers with the capability of writing Objective-C, Swift or Java apps, but with Ruby. RubyMotion allows Ruby developers to use their editor of choice, includes an exclusion list of gems, and incorporates built in testing and debugging features. Laurent Sansonetti, a former Apple Software Engineer, worked on Apple's own OS X operation system and created MacRuby, which later evolved to RubyMotion, to allow developers create Mac applications written in Ruby.
